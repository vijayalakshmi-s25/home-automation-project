# Home Automation Project

This repository contains a Home Automation project using the 8051 microcontroller. The system controls a fan and a light using relays and is simulated in Proteus.

## Project Structure

- r.c - Embedded C code for 8051 microcontroller (Relay control logic)
- relay.hex - Compiled hex file for simulation
- relay.uvopt - Keil µVision project files
- smarthome.pdsprj - Proteus simulation schematic

## How to Run

1. Open smarthome.pdsprj in Proteus.
2. Load relay.hex into the microcontroller.
3. Run the simulation to see fan/light control using relay.

## Tools Used

- Keil µVision for Embedded C programming
- Proteus for circuit design and simulation
- GitHub for version control and sharing
